E-mail writing totally follows the 80/20 rule. I often find myself composing the bulk of an email in ~5 minutes, and then spending ~20 minutes making tiny improvements that are basically irrelevant. This is a horrible waste of time. 

I wrote this app to help me not do that: http://ancient-earth-8054.herokuapp.com. 

After signing into your GMail account, you write in the title of the email, your recipients, and your time limit. You are then taken to a page with a textbox and a send button. If you don't press the send button yourself by the time limit (e.g. if you run out of time or close the page), whatever was in the textbox will get sent. 

This app was a fun foray into Sidekiq, OAuth, and the Rails mailer, and marked my first usage of integration testing.
